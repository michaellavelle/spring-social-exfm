This project is the beginnings of a spring-social module for Ex.FM.  

As Spring Social interacts with OAuth APIs, and Ex.Fm's current API is non-oauth,  this module is not *yet* fully compatible all of the Spring Social framework.   If Ex.FM do implement OAuth in future API versions this project contains the Spring-Social binding classes to support this - clients of this module will need only to supply url's for the OAuth endpoints.

Although not yet fully compatible with Spring Social, this project does include a Java API client for the current non-oauth Ex.Fm API.    Only a few of the API methods have been added so far, such as retrieving a user's profile and loved song, and pagination of response's containing lists has not yet been implemented.
